						<h2 class="major">Who am I?</h2>
						<p>Starting off with the deep, philosophical questions. I'm a long-distance running, Magic: the
							Gathering duelist
							who loves to build fun webapps. My favorite three things are running across the Golden Gate
							Bridge,
							creating gameplay environments for my friends in Magic, and using React to make responsive,
							fun apps.</p>

						<h2 class="major">How did I get here?</h2>
						<p>Picture the summer of 2019, when we could freely walk around, socialize and travel.
							I had a trip to Japan coming up and wanted to learn Japanese. I thought it would be fun to
							learn Javascript
							and build a single page app that my girlfriend and I could use to study.
							About a month and hundreds and hundreds of lines of code later, I discovered that I really
							just wanted to
							program and build, so I ditched my previous career and started studying and building
							full-time. </p>

						<h2 class="major">What have I done?</h2>
						<p>My main focus has been on creating fun websites that show my passion for coding as well as
							some sense of my style,
							personality and humor. These projects included the full range of steps needed for a website
							to go from an idea to
							reality: schema design, backend development and RESTful API routes with Ruby on Rails,
							front-end with React/Redux
							and Node.js and deployment with Webpack, Git and Heroku.</p>

							<h3 class="major">Beatup</h3>
							<p>Beatup was created using Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL on the backend and React, Redux,
								CSS and HTML on the frontend.
								Beatup was inspired by Meetup and Slack and created to help fighters find a squad and
								nearby brawls.
								Over the past month or so I've been in the process of a full refactor of the code to
								improve code quality,
								reinforce single-responsibility for components and take advantage of React's useState,
								useEffect and a couple of custom hooks.

							<h3 class="major">Kirby Kount</h3>
							<p>Kirby Kount was created using Javascript, Canvas, HTML, CSS and a heavy dose of OOP.
								Kirby Kount was the first app I created. In its original
								incarnation, it was simply capable of generating math problems in Japanese. But like
								every good game, there was a sequel. I added an
								educational game using sprites and Canvas as well as Cantonese and Mandarin support and
								text-to-character and text-to-audio.
								Kirby Kount is definitely the most fun I've had building anything. Try it out!

							<h3 class="major">Big Bad Wolf</h3>
							<p>Big Bad Wolf was a group project and created using MongoDB and Express on the backend
								with React, Redux, CSS, Canvas and HTML on the front end.
								My particular contribution to this project was the lobby and game server systems that
								allow for multiple live chat rooms and game instances using
								Node and Websockets as well as the front-end rendering of the sprites via Canvas.

							<h3 class="major">My Cat Ash</h3>
							<p>I wanted this section to be a balanced four panels so I looked around for inspiration and
								saw my cat staring up at me, waiting for an opportunity to jump up
								on me and settle on the comfy, warm laptop.
